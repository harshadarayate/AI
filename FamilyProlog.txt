mother(M, C) :-
    female(M),
    parent(M, C).

grandparent(GP, GC) :-
    parent(GP, P),
    parent(P, GC).

% Rule 4: S1 and S2 are siblings
sibling(S1, S2) :-
    parent(P, S1),
    parent(P, S2),
    S1 \== S2. % S1 and S2 are not the same person

% --- Example Queries and Results ---

% Query 1: Who is the father of Lisa?
% ?- father(F, lisa).
% F = john.

% Query 2: Who are David's grandparents?
% ?- grandparent(GP, david).
% GP = john ;
% GP = susan ;
% GP = john ;
% GP = susan.
% (Note: Prolog finds all possible paths, so results may be duplicated)

% Query 3: Who is Peter's sister?
% ?- sister(Sis, peter).
% Sis = lisa.

% Query 4: Who are John's children?
% ?- parent(john, Child).
% Child = peter ;
% Child = lisa.


-----------------
father(F, C) :- male(F), parent(F, C).
Meaning: "F is the father of C if F is male and F is a parent of C."



Query 1: ?- father(F, lisa).

You ask: "Who is the father of Lisa?" (Find a value for F where father(F, lisa) is true).

Prolog uses the rule: father(F, C) :- male(F), parent(F, C).

It sets C = lisa and tries to solve two sub-goals:

    male(F)
    parent(F, lisa)

It searches the facts:

    male(john)? Yes. Now check parent(john, lisa)? Yes.
    Both are true. So, F = john is a solution.

Result: F = john.
